New coding project containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project is to continue my practice of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. I have finished creating a basic landing page with study guide notes for my coding bootcamp pre work modules. However, I wanted to continue putting into practice my knowledge of what I know so far (which is basic).
- I dont want to just learn and take notes, but I want to apply what I learn, and this calculator project is just the start. 
- I built this project because I wanted to develop something different yet a bit more challenging than just a "landing page."
- This calculator can be used to help otheres to calculate simply or complex math problems. And of course, this is created just for fun and practice!
